# Copycontigfiles
Copy and re-name SPAdes contig files to a new folder.
This is quite useful when assembling multiple bacterial genomes using SPAdes. 
Newly assembled contig files from each genome could be renamed according to their fasq files and copied to a new folder, which is easy for downstream analysis, such as phylogenetic analysis using KSNP3.
